# Facial Expression Recognition 

This project implements a **Facial Expression Recognition** model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in Python with Keras/TensorFlow. The goal is to classify facial images into emotional categories such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, neutral, etc.

## 🔍 Objective

To build and evaluate a deep learning model that can accurately recognize facial expressions from static images using CNN.

## 📦 Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains categorized facial expression images. It may be similar to or based on the **FER-2013** dataset or any similar emotion dataset.

Each image is labeled with one of the facial expressions:
- Angry
- Disgust
- Fear
- Happy
- Sad
- Surprise
- Neutral

## 🧠 Model Architecture

- Input: 48x48 grayscale facial images
- Layers: Multiple Conv2D + MaxPooling layers
- Activation: ReLU
- Final layer: Dense + Softmax for multi-class classification

## 📈 Evaluation

- Accuracy and loss are plotted using `matplotlib`
- Model is trained and validated using a validation split or a separate validation dataset
- Confusion matrix and classification report can be added for deeper insight

## 📊 Libraries Used

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV (optional, for image processing)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/facial-expression-recognition.git
   cd facial-expression-recognition

2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the notebook:
   jupyter notebook Facial_Expression_recognation.ipynb

4. Train the model and evaluate results

## ✅ Results

The model achieves a reasonable accuracy in classifying facial expressions and can be further improved with:
- Data augmentation
- Transfer learning
- More complex architectures

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Deploy model as a web app using Flask or Streamlit
- Integrate with live webcam for real-time prediction
- Train on a larger, more diverse dataset
